# Capybara - An analyzer for Java bytecode

An analyzer for Java bytecode, currently relying on "brute-force" symbolic execution.

This software has mostly been developed for learning purposes. It has demonstrated its ability to find some bugs in example programs 
(see a toy example [here](src/test/resources/testprojects/TargetedTestCases)), but use at your own risks!
